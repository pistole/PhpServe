This is basically an incomplete work-in-progress.

I hit a wall when I discovered that the PHP CLI SAPI ignores all header calls 
completely (even internal calls like the cookie functions use).

Large portions are a refactoring of bib_server 
(http://www.phpclasses.org/package/4084-PHP-Web-server-in-pure-PHP.html), but 
there are still large amounts of cleanup to be done before I could possibly be
happy with the code.

Anyway, I hope this might be useful to somebody someday, and who knows, maybe
my patch to PHP will be approved and I can finish this.

(Yes, I could require php-cgi, but that defeats the purpose, it's not available
out of the box in a lot of places).

Anyway, bib_server was released without a license, so I feel comfortable in 
slapping a BSD-style license on the package as a whole.

Many thanks to Anthony Bush for Awb_File, which means portions of this 
software are copyright 2011 Anthony Bush.
